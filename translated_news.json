            "full_content": "The team behind President Donald Trump’s crypto operations is on an aggressive accumulation spree of crypto assets before and during the 2025 inauguration ceremony. According to blockchain intelligence and “de-anonymizing” platform Arkham, World Liberty Financial (WLFI) – the Trump family’s crypto project – bought over $50 million worth of cryptocurrencies in the hours leading up to the new President being sworn in. Trump’s purchases include blockchain oracle service Chainlink (LINK), lending platform Aave, Justin Sun’s TRON (TRX), synthetic dollar protocol Ethena (ENA), top smart contract Ethereum (ETH) and the Ethereum-based Bitcoin Wrapped BTC (WBTC). “TRUMP’S WORLD LIBERTY FI BUYING $50M+ OF CRYPTO RIGHT NOW In the past hour or so, Donald Trump’s project World Liberty Fi has purchased: $4.7M of LINK\n$4.7M of AAVE\n$4.7M of TRX\n$4.7M of ENA\n3x $4.7M of WBTC\n4x $4.7M of ETH How much more will they buy?” And during the precise moments that Trump was being sworn in by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Arkham reported that World Liberty Financial purchased $4.69 million worth of WBTC. “DONALD TRUMP IS NOW 47TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE INSTANT HE WAS SWORN IN, TRUMP’S PROJECT WORLD LIBERTY FI BOUGHT $4.7 MILLION USD OF BITCOIN” At time of writing, according to Arkham’s data, World Liberty Financial holds $329 million worth of crypto assets. At the same time, Donald Trump’s personal wallet is holding about $9.6 million worth of crypto, and his official memecoin TRUMP has a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of over $44 billion, 80% of which is controlled by his team’s wallets. First Lady Melania Trump also launched her own memecoin which is valued at over $6 billion.

            "full_content": "Gary Gensler's time as Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially come to an end. Today marks his final day in the role he took on in 2021, a position that concluded a notable chapter in his extensive career in public service. Gensler’s tenure at the SEC was built upon a wealth of experience from his previous positions, including as Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and in various senior roles at the U.S. Treasury. His leadership at the SEC was shaped by his deep understanding of financial markets, a critical asset in advancing the agency’s core mission of investor protection and market efficiency. The SEC reflected positively on Gensler’s leadership, praising his ability to work across party lines while maintaining respect for differing views. This approach, they noted, was instrumental in enhancing the agency’s ability to serve the public. Gensler’s emphasis on cooperative policymaking left a lasting impact, and the SEC expressed gratitude for his contributions in steering the organization forward during his time as Chairman. \n\n\n\n Mark Cuban has sharply criticized the TRUMP memecoin, which was launched around the time of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of ConsenSys, has expressed his belief that the growth of Web3 will be far more significant than the dot-com boom of the 1990s. President Donald Trump has appointed Mark Uyeda, currently a Commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as the acting Chairman of the agency. Donald Trump’s recent launch of the TRUMP memecoin has stirred debate in the cryptocurrency world, with both its meteoric rise and ethical questions taking center stage.

            "full_content": "As XRP’s role in the U.S. Treasury is speculated, it could redefine Ripple’s future.  As the new Trump administration begins, the market is poised for potential transformations, with XRP emerging as a front-runner in the evolving U.S. digital asset landscape. Following President-elect Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to head the SEC, many believe the legal challenges facing Ripple could be revisited or dropped entirely, which could mark a turning point for the crypto asset. With rumors swirling about the U.S. Treasury potentially holding digital assets, could XRP find itself in the U.S. Treasury’s vaults as a reserve asset?  As the new Trump administration begins, the U.S. is positioning itself to lead the global crypto landscape. Trump’s commitment to blockchain technology and financial freedom is spotlighted by his support for a crypto-friendly agenda, including the appointment of David Sacks as the first AI and Cryptocurrency Czar. Additionally, Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick for SEC Chairman, has a history of supporting the crypto industry. His leadership could reshape the SEC’s approach toward Ripple, especially regarding the ongoing lawsuit. With Atkins potentially shifting priorities, there’s speculation that the SEC might drop its case against Ripple, paving the way for XRP’s growth and possibly even its inclusion as a reserve asset in the U.S. Treasury. XRP becoming a reserve asset within the U.S. Treasury could significantly boost its long-term valuation. With a market cap surpassing $180 billion, XRP’s adoption by the Treasury would diversify its holdings and align with the growing institutional recognition of digital assets. XRP’s lower volatility, with a 70% reduction in price swings over the past year compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, makes it a more stable option. As the U.S. embraces blockchain, XRP’s role in facilitating efficient cross-border payments positions it as a strong contender. This move could drive institutional adoption, solidifying XRP’s place in global finance and increasing its potential as a trusted digital asset for governments and central banks. Source: TradingView XRP’s recent surge stands out amid a volatile crypto market, outpacing Solana [SOL] and Cardano [ADA]. In contrast, Bitcoin [BTC] saw a modest 15.49% gain, while Ethereum [ETH] posted only slight growth. This could be attributed to potential XRP adoption and improved sentiment around Ripple’s legal and regulatory future. Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2025-26 XRP’s rally highlights its unique position in the market, offering both speculative and functional value. As discussions around XRP’s potential use as a reserve asset intensify, it could emerge as a leader and a key player in the crypto-government dynamic.    Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

            "full_content": "The Trump family's blockchain ambitions accelerate WLFI's pre-sale, drawing major backing from Justin Sun. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi platform associated with Donald Trump, is seeing a sudden surge in demand for its token pre-sale. The project initially sought to raise $300 million during its token sale but scaled back its target to $30 million after facing fundraising challenges. However, on Jan. 20, WLFI confirmed that it successfully sold 20% of its total token supply during its pre-sale phase and revealed plans to unlock an additional 5% of the tokens for sale due to the overwhelming demand. It stated: “Great news! An additional 5% of our token supply is now available to purchase on our website. We appreciate the overwhelming support and look forward to welcoming so many new people to our community!” The project advised interested buyers to “only purchase using the link in our bio to avoid scams.” Market observers have linked the sudden heightened interest to Trump’s launch of an “official meme coin” on the Solana blockchain during the weekend. This bolstered confidence in the President-elect’s crypto-positive outlook, with many viewing his influence as a catalyst for growth in the blockchain industry. Meanwhile, WLFI’s sell-out marks a complete turnaround for a project that had previously struggled in its fundraising efforts. Since Trump’s political win in November, WLFI has experienced remarkable growth, with its token profits increasing by 95% to $300 million, according to Dune Analytics data. Notably, one of the many believers in the token is Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain. On Jan. 20, he revealed that he invested an additional $45 million in the DeFi platform, following his earlier contribution of $30 million. This brings Tron’s total backing of the project to $75 million. He wrote: “We are continuing to increase our investment in World Liberty Financial, with an additional $45 million, bringing the total investment to $75 million.” Blockchain analytics platform Nansen revealed that Sun acquired 1 billion WLFI tokens for $15 million in USDT, solidifying TronDAO as the largest independent token holder. According to EtherScan data, TronDAO owns 3 billion tokens out of WLFI’s total supply of 100 billion, surpassing over 34,000 other holders. World Liberty Financial’s recent actions have sparked curiosity within the crypto community about the project’s next move. On Jan. 19, the blockchain analysis platform SpotOnChain reported that the platform made a significant Ethereum purchase, acquiring $20 million worth of ETH in just 20 minutes using $5 million worth of USDC and $15 million USDT. With this purchase, World Liberty Financial owns over 46,000 ETH worth $157 million. In addition, WLFI has reportedly purchased three Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains—trumpcoin.eth, erictrump.eth, and barrontrump.eth—for key members of the Trump family. This move suggests the project’s intention to create a stronger digital presence tied to its prominent figures. Amid all of these activities, Donald Trump Jr., an advisor to the project, stated: “World Liberty Financial will revolutionize DeFi/Cefi and will be the future of finance. We are just getting started!” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

            "full_content": "Veteran trader Peter Brandt claimed ADA has “bottomed for a grand bull market.” TL;DR  The cryptocurrency market has been on a tear in the past several hours, with some leading digital assets reaching unseen levels. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, tapped an all-time high of over $109,000 earlier today (January 20). Cardano’s ADA has also recorded a solid performance in the past several days despite not hitting a new peak. Its price is up over 15% on a weekly scale, currently trading at approximately $1.09 (per CoinGecko’s data).\n Numerous industry participants think the recent rally could be just the ignition of a massive surge for Cardano’s native token. The veteran trader Peter Brandt believes the altseason is incoming, with ADA poised for a “grand bull market.” X user Ssebi also touched upon the matter, claiming that the token’s price has touched the 20-day Moving Average (MA) and “bounced off it.”  “I think we are about to see an explosion for ADA in the next few days. The liquidity from TRUMP has got to flow somewhere,” they assumed. Other market observers outlining price predictions lately include Dan Gambardello and Altcoin Daily. The former thinks ADA has “one of the most bullish weekly pattern setups in crypto,” envisioning a potential price explosion to as high as $7. Altcoin Daily forecasted that the valuation might hit $6.45 sometime in 2025.  Trump’s incoming presidency is considered good news by the crypto community in general due to his positive stance toward the industry outlined in the past several months. Cardano’s ADA is among the digital assets that may experience a substantial rally due to his return to the White House, considering Hoskinson’s disclosure in November last year.  Back then, Cardano’s founder revealed his intentions to work alongside Trump’s cabinet to create a comprehensive and possibly more favorable regulatory environment for the crypto industry.  In addition, Cardano’s ecosystem is set to undergo some essential developments this year, and that possible progress might trigger a positive effect on the price of the native token. Some of the improvements involve the Hydra scaling solution.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025  While initial buyers were cautious, thinking the announcement to be a result of hackers, crypto sleuths soon discovered the launch to be legitimate. Funds began to flow into the token one to three hours post-launch. The memecoin’s legitimacy, fuelled by Trump’s popularity in the crypto space and his political position, drew traders who transacted a total volume of around $27 billion over the 24 hours after the token’s launch. Solana rallied from $219.53 on Saturday morning to a high of around $290 on Sunday morning. However, the price didn’t close above the previous all-time high on the daily time frame. The price fell slightly from the new all-time high Sunday afternoon as open interest levels on Binance declined. SOL’s price has begun to recover and trades at $264.32 as of publishing.

These newly launched coins accumulated a combined market worth of more than $16 billion in no time. However, the peculiar surge following market instability has sparked widespread criticism, with allegations of financial greed and ‘pump-and-dump’ practices ruining Trump’s reputation.  On Jan. 18, the self-branded ‘Official Trump’ ($TRUMP) token debuted and reached an incredible $15 billion market valuation in hours. Just a day later, Melania Trump launched her meme coin, $MELANIA, which peaked at $13 billion before losing over half its value. Critics believe that the back-to-back releases appeared to put personal financial gain over moral concerns, describing the actions as exploitative.  The rapid rise and fall of the tokens has prompted financial analysts to question the reasons behind these launches. Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, said that Trump’s decision to release $MELANIA shortly after $TRUMP’s success was motivated by avarice.  “He tried to double down with a $MELANIA, but the market thinks it is a form of dilution and assumes/fears that Trump has tons of other coins in the wings to come.” The immediate impact made $TRUMP’s value fall 38% after $MELANIA’s introduction, wiping out billions of dollars in market capitalization. The launch time of these meme coins has raised concerns with analysts pointing to the financial chaos and Donald Trump’s inaugural preparations. Edward Dowd, the creator of Phinance Technologies, called the scenario the largest unforced error ever made before a Presidential inauguration. Others like financial expert Michael A. Gayed, were more direct, accusing the tokens of being textbook ‘pump-and-dump’ operations.

Trump’s credibility has been totally destroyed entering the inauguration because fucking $TRUMP and fucking $MELANIA.Like and repost if you understand this. Delphi Labs co-founder José Maria Macedo suggested that the insiders behind the $TRUMP token were taken aback by its rapid popularity: “My read is that the insiders who helped launch $TRUMP didn’t realize how much it would pump and either didn’t buy enough or sold too early”. Macedon further highlighted the huge losses caused by the tokens’ volatile performance and estimated $30 billion in total value destruction.  Ryan Selkis, Messari’s former CEO and a Trump supporter called for quick action, advising Trump to remove those who launched $MELANIA. Selkis argued that the team behind the token lacked the expertise to safeguard Trump’s interests, exacerbating the image of poor management.  Also read: Crypto ETF Filings Surge as Gensler’s SEC Tenure Nears End The meme coin debacle occurred during a cryptocurrency market bloodbath. Bitcoin fell 6% over the weekend, from $105,900 to less than $99,650. Despite the response, the combined market capitalization of $TRUMP and $MELANIA is still impressive at more than $16 billion. However, the incident has cast suspicion on the family’s cryptocurrency projects, raising concerns about the ethical limitations of using political power for financial gains.  Even though meme coins have caught traders’ interest, any potential financial advantage could be overshadowed by negative perceptions and fraud claims. With political credibility and public trust at stake, the stakes are higher than ever for a well-known figure like Donald Trump. Also read: Trump and Dump?

This milestone reflects strong buying demand and growing market optimism for the leading cryptocurrency. BTC is currently trading just below its peak, but bullish momentum suggests the rally could continue.\n                                                                Despite a challenging market environment, BTC’s price remains supported by increased spot inflows, which have reached a 30-day high. According to Coinglass, this rise in inflows signals growing interest and robust buying activity. The balance of power (BoP) indicator, currently trending positively, confirms that buyers are dominating and pushing prices upward.\n                                                                When spot inflows rise, more funds enter the market, often leading to higher demand. With limited supply, this demand has been a key driver of BTC’s upward trajectory. Analysts suggest that if this momentum persists, Bitcoin could surpass its latest peak and aim for the $110,000 mark. However, increased selloffs might push the price below $100,000.\n                                              Bitcoin’s performance is also expected to face volatility around Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration.

The senators allege these contributions may influence regulatory actions and grant special favors from the incoming administration.\n                                                                OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has come under scrutiny for a $1 million personal donation to Trump’s inaugural fund. Altman clarified that the donation was made in a personal capacity and not on behalf of his company.

            "full_content": "A closely followed crypto analyst thinks that huge upside bursts are in the cards for Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA). Crypto strategist Ali Martinez tells his 115,00 followers on the social media platform X that the native asset of the decentralized oracle Chainlink appears to have broken out of a bull flag on the four-hour chart. A bull flag is often viewed as a bullish continuation pattern, suggesting that an asset is taking a break before moving higher. Says Martinez, “Chainlink LINK is breaking out of a bullish flag, targeting $50!” At time of writing, LINK is trading for $24.43, translating to a potential rise of over 100% if the altcoin hits the target. Turning to the smart contract platform Cardano, Martinez says ADA can spark a massive 426% rally from current levels if it follows in the footsteps of its 2021 price action. “After a 44% correction, Cardano ADA began its second leg up during the week of February 1, 2021. Now, ADA has already undergone a 43% correction, suggesting the next leg up could be just two to three weeks away. $6 next!” At time of writing, ADA is worth $1.14. As for fellow layer-1 protocol Solana (SOL), Martinez says the altcoin could witness astronomical gains after shattering the resistance of a bullish pattern. “Solana SOL has broken out of a cup-and-handle pattern, signaling a potential upside target of $4,700!” A cup-and-handle structure suggests that buyers are no longer waiting for lower levels before entering the market, leading to higher prices for the asset. At time of writing, SOL is trading for $275.

This reform has been in progress for nearly a year and aims to align the foundation’s goals with the evolving needs of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n                                                                Vitalik Buterin shared on X that the changes are intended to fill gaps in technical expertise and improve the foundation’s collaboration with key ecosystem players, including developers, wallet providers, Layer-2 networks, and users. The updates also focus on enhancing decentralization, privacy, and open-source principles while advancing Ethereum’s role as a robust, censorship-resistant platform for decentralized applications.\n                                                                The foundation is also planning to integrate more decentralized technologies into its internal processes, such as payments and treasury management. Over the past year, the Ethereum Foundation has faced criticism for being too passive and concerns about its spending and operational priorities. These reforms aim to rebuild trust and strengthen relationships within the ecosystem.\n                                                                Buterin emphasized that the foundation will remain neutral and avoid political lobbying or catering to specific interests, preserving Ethereum’s position as a global platform. He reaffirmed EF’s dedication to empowering developers and fostering innovation rather than engaging in political influence. “The Ethereum Foundation will not aggressively lobby regulators or political figures, especially in powerful countries like the USA. We must maintain Ethereum as a neutral global platform,” Buterin stated.\n                                              In addition to Buterin’s remarks, co-founder Joseph Lubin proposed a dual-leadership model for guiding the foundation into its next phase. Lubin suggested that Ethereum developer Danny Ryan and Ethereum France President Jérôme de Tychey take on leadership roles to balance technical and business strategies. Lubin highlighted their ability to navigate the challenges of the fast-changing blockchain industry while upholding Ethereum’s core principles.\n                                                                Lubin also stressed the importance of maintaining neutrality, likening Ethereum to Switzerland. Switzerland is a neutral nation that actively promotes its values and fosters international relationships. Lubin argued Ethereum could adopt a similar approach, championing its technological advancements while remaining impartial. He encouraged the community to advocate for Ethereum’s role in building a better future.\n                                                                Lubin concluded by emphasizing the need for energy, creativity, and determination in Ethereum’s leadership to ensure it continues to be the most trusted and versatile blockchain ecosystem.

            "full_content": "The launch of Donald Trump’s memecoin, TRUMP, on the Solana blockchain is generating waves across the cryptocurrency world. Analyst Miles Deutscher sees this as a transformative moment, with wide-ranging implications for the industry—both positive and negative. Trump’s decision to use Solana for his memecoin has sparked excitement, positioning the network as a potential frontrunner in the U.S. crypto ecosystem. This endorsement could not only enhance Solana’s visibility but also boost its adoption, earning it the moniker “America’s chain.” For Deutscher, this move signifies more than just a technical choice—it signals Trump’s commitment to embracing the crypto space, potentially influencing U.S. policy in favor of blockchain technologies, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other emerging digital assets. Increased attention on the TRUMP launch has also driven a wave of mainstream curiosity, with apps like Moonshot climbing app store rankings as interest surges. Deutscher sees this as a pivotal moment for innovation in the U.S. crypto market, with the potential to attract new capital and broaden public engagement. However, this enthusiasm is tempered by some concerning possibilities. Deutscher warns that TRUMP’s popularity could drain liquidity from other altcoins, destabilizing parts of the market. The project could also draw criticism from policymakers, potentially complicating future efforts to promote crypto-friendly legislation. Additionally, the success of this memecoin might inspire a flood of similar projects, leading to market oversaturation and undermining the broader ecosystem. Another concern is the impact on Ethereum. As Solana’s role in this high-profile launch gains traction, Ethereum’s dominance could face further challenges, pushing traders to reallocate resources. Deutscher also flagged the risk of increased volatility, suggesting the event might accelerate the market cycle and signal an overheated environment. Ultimately, Deutscher believes the true significance of Trump’s memecoin will unfold in the weeks to come, as Trump’s vision for the initiative becomes clearer. While the launch represents a unique opportunity for growth and innovation, it also highlights the complexities of balancing attention-grabbing moves with the long-term stability of the crypto industry. \n\n\n\n Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, recently suggested that the Ethereum Foundation is exploring the possibility of staking its vast reserves of ETH, which are currently valued at nearly $1 billion. Mark Cuban has sharply criticized the TRUMP memecoin, which was launched around the time of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of ConsenSys, has expressed his belief that the growth of Web3 will be far more significant than the dot-com boom of the 1990s. President Donald Trump has appointed Mark Uyeda, currently a Commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as the acting Chairman of the agency.

            "full_content": "On January 20, he plans to issue an executive order that will elevate the status of cryptocurrencies in U.S. policy. The elected President of the United States, Donald Trump, intends to issue an executive order elevating cryptocurrencies to a priority in policy and giving industry representatives a voice in his administration, according to Bloomberg sources. According to the agency, crypto assets will become a national priority. This status calls for government agencies to collaborate with the industry. The creation of a cryptocurrency advisory council is also planned to advocate for the industry's political priorities. Trump enjoys strong support in the crypto sector due to his promises to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and generally be loyal to the industry. Several major players in the digital asset ecosystem have made significant donations to the elected president's inauguration fund. The order marks a shift in attitude towards the crypto sector, which has faced persecution in recent years. The SEC has filed over 100 lawsuits against cryptocurrency-related companies, and banking regulators have complicated their operations with traditional financial institutions. According to Bloomberg, discussions are currently ongoing regarding including directives in the order that would require all federal agencies to review their policies on digital assets and possibly suspend legal actions. On January 15, it became known that the SEC under Donald Trump's administration may review lawsuits against cryptocurrency companies in the early days and even withdraw some that are currently under consideration. Initial initiatives in the U.S. after Trump's inauguration may address \"debanking\" industry companies and accounting rules for digital assets (SAB 121). The creation of a national reserve of the first cryptocurrency is also being explored. The document could appear on the day of the president's inauguration on January 20; however, the current version is not final. \"I think Donald Trump is going to signal that the United States is back and ready to lead in this industry,\" commented Kara Calvert, head of U.S. policy at Coinbase.  On January 16, the New York Post reported that Trump is considering forming a strategic reserve of \"U.S.-created\" digital assets such as SOL, USDC, and XRP. In recent weeks, he has met with founders of these projects. Insiders from the newspaper expressed skepticism about this idea since it would shift focus away from Bitcoin. However, Unchained sources refuted information about the future U.S. president's desire to create an \"altcoin reserve.\" Ripple's Senior Director of Communications Susan Hendrick confirmed to the publication that CEO Brad Garlinghouse urged Trump to diversify potential cryptocurrency reserves beyond BTC. In early January, news emerged about their dinner meeting. On January 15, Axios published Trump's comments made to representatives of an unnamed company. \"You guys made a certain amount of money last year, and now thanks to me, you’ll make a lot more. But when I needed you, where the hell were you? You weren't there for me; maybe you were with her [Kamala Harris],\" he said.  According to Unchained, the conversation took place with representatives from Ripple. The company's CLO Stewart Alderoti denied this information.  \"Wow, unnamed sources? Here’s a named source: me. The rumors published by this third-tier crypto rag are pure fiction. Completely made up.I wonder who’s behind this?\", he stated.  In October 2024, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen sent $1 million in XRP to a political action committee (PAC) supporting Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. XRP dynamics Amid rumors about adding XRP to the U.S. national reserve, the coin's price demonstrated rapid upward movement. On January 16, the crypto asset approached its historical maximum of $3.4 on Bitfinex, Kraken, and Binance for the first time since January 2018. In January 2018, XRP reached $3.31 on Bitstamp and remained below that price for seven years. In mid-January 2025, Santiment analysts noted that large whale purchases were the main growth factor. Experts highlighted \"significant accumulation\" of assets by wallets holding between 1 million XRP and 10 million XRP. Since November 12, 2024, the number of coins on whale addresses has increased by 1.43 billion—37.4% of their total balances. Coinbase premium Despite Trump's apparent desire to make cryptocurrencies a national priority, Bitcoin is trading at a slight discount on Coinbase compared to Binance.  This indicates moderate demand for digital gold in the U.S. The indicator reflects the price difference of Bitcoin on American exchanges compared to Binance. The higher the value, the stronger demand for Bitcoin in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world. It should be noted that experts from K33 Research stated in mid-January that Trump's inauguration is already an \"overplayed\" event.

            "full_content": "TON’s historic low volatility hints at a critical turning point – will it lead to a breakout or breakdown?  Periods of calm are rare in the crypto market and often hint at seismic shifts on the horizon. Toncoin [TON] is experiencing one such moment.  Recent data reveals that the blockchain project’s 7-day and 30-day Annualized Realized Volatility has plunged to historic lows, signaling a phase of relative quiet. For seasoned traders, this could be more than just a statistical anomaly. Historically, prolonged periods of low volatility in crypto markets have acted as precursors to sharp price movements, either upward or downward.   As TON enters this critical juncture, all eyes are on whether the current lull will transform into a breakout or a breakdown. Annualized Realized Volatility measures the actual historical price fluctuations of an asset over a specific period, expressed on an annualized basis. This metric is pivotal in crypto markets because it highlights periods of stability or turbulence, offering traders insights into potential market behavior. A low volatility phase often indicates a market in balance, but such equilibrium rarely lasts long in the highly speculative markets. Source: CryptoQuant TON’s 7-day Annualized Realized Volatility shows more short-term responsiveness to market movements, while the 30-day metric captures longer-term trends. Currently, both metrics are at historical lows, signaling an unprecedented calm in TON’s price movements. This calm could precede significant market action, making it a critical metric to monitor. Source: CryptoQuant Low volatility typically signals reduced trading activity or investor interest, often reflecting a market in consolidation.  For TON, the current historic lows suggest an equilibrium, with neither buyers nor sellers driving strong price momentum. This dormancy phase, however, has historically served as the calm before the storm in crypto markets. Examining TON’s history, periods of low volatility have frequently preceded sharp price changes. In mid-2022, after a prolonged low-volatility phase, TON’s price surged from $1.30 to over $2.00 within weeks—a 50% increase.  Similarly, in early 2023, low volatility led to a breakout that saw prices rise from $2.50 to nearly $4.50, marking an 80% rally. Broader crypto trends reinforce this pattern. For instance, Bitcoin’s extended consolidation around $6,000 in 2018 led to a steep breakdown below $4,000. Ethereum showed similar behavior in mid-2020 before the DeFi bull run began. Read Toncoin’s [TON] Price Prediction 2025-26 Source: TradingView TON’s low volatility hints at a critical juncture. The RSI indicates mild bearish momentum, but not oversold conditions yet. This suggests that sellers dominate, but exhaustion may be near. Meanwhile, OBV reflects declining volume, confirming reduced trading activity—a classic low-volatility signal. Upside potential could stem from a reversal in RSI alongside renewed buying interest. A break above the $5.50 resistance could trigger bullish momentum, targeting $6.00 or beyond. Conversely, a breach below $4.70 support, combined with persistently low OBV, might signal further declines toward $4.30. External factors, such as market trends or ecosystem developments, will likely determine the direction of the impending breakout.    Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

            "full_content": "Cryptocurrency research firm Alphractal has issued a warning, suggesting that Bitcoin may be nearing a local peak. Based on their analysis, the firm predicts that Bitcoin’s price could reach a local top around the $111,000 mark. This forecast is grounded in the Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD) metric, which Alphractal describes as one of the most effective tools for identifying price bottoms in Bitcoin’s market.  The firm highlights the $111,000 price point as a significant resistance level. The analysts explained that the CVDD Channel, which is composed of several lines derived from the CVDD metric, provides a reliable means of pinpointing support and resistance zones. They estimate that the $111,110 level represents a key resistance point. While breaking this barrier could signal bullish momentum, Alphractal cautioned that this level might continue to act as a ceiling for Bitcoin’s price in the short term. \n\n\n\n Bitcoin surged past $109,000, setting a new all-time high, as excitement surrounding Donald Trump’s inauguration fueled market momentum. The cryptocurrency market witnessed a surge in ETP inflows last week, hitting a record $2.2 billion, according to a recent report. Around 06:00 GMT on Monday, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of around $109,000 on Binance. The crypto market has experienced over $1.2 billion in liquidations in the past 24 hours, as Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000 after nearing its all-time high.

While Cuban’s remarks may be sarcastic, they highlight the ongoing frenzy and risks in the meme coin market, where scammers often prey on inexperienced investors.\n                                                                On social media, Cuban joked about launching a meme coin with terms similar to the popular TRUMP token. “All revenue would be donated to the U.S. Treasury, and the wallet address would be publicly visible,” he said, adding that it could at least help reduce the national debt while offering a speculative opportunity.\n                                                                Although technically feasible—since the Treasury accepts private donations—Cuban’s comments reflect his frustration with the recent meme coin explosion. Tokens like TRUMP and MELANIA, launched just before Trump’s inauguration, became billion-dollar assets overnight, overshadowing long-established crypto projects.\n                                                                Cuban has criticized the simplicity with which meme coins are created, warning that this trend invites scams. “If meme coins are the future, then everyone should just create their own TRUMP and MELANIA tokens. Nothing is stopping you. Use Solana, Ethereum, Base, or any blockchain and get paid!” he posted, mocking the situation.\n                                              The meme coin market is increasingly associated with rug pulls, where token creators suddenly withdraw funds, leaving investors with worthless assets. Over the weekend, figures linked to Trump were reportedly involved in such schemes, including a pastor who launched a questionable token. Surveys show many buyers of TRUMP tokens are newcomers to crypto, making them prime targets for scams.\n                                                                Cuban’s remarks underscore concerns about the crypto industry’s reputation.

            "full_content": "In a groundbreaking move towards embracing digital finance, Utah has introduced a bill titled “Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments (H.B. 230)“, which would allow the state’s treasury to invest in cryptocurrencies. The bill, presented by State Representative Jordan Teuscher, seeks to integrate blockchain technology into the state’s financial strategy, marking Utah as a potential pioneer in state-level cryptocurrency investment. Under the proposed legislation, the Utah State Treasurer would be empowered to allocate up to 10% of several key state accounts into digital assets. These accounts include the State Disaster Recovery Restricted Account, General Fund Budget Reserve Account, Income Tax Fund Budget Reserve Account, and Medicaid Growth Reduction and Budget Stabilization Account. This move is aimed at diversifying state investments and potentially reaping benefits from the volatile yet lucrative crypto market. To qualify for investment, digital assets must either have a market capitalization exceeding $500 billion, averaged over 12 months, or be stablecoins with stringent backing requirements, like being supported by the US. dollars or high-quality liquid assets, alongside regulatory approval. This criterion effectively narrows down the investment options to major players like Bitcoin or select stablecoins. To cater for the security of the investments, the H.B. 230 bill mandates that cryptographic private keys be stored in highly secure, encrypted environments accessible only through end-to-end encrypted channels. Additionally, hardware containing these keys must be housed in at least two geographically diverse secure data centres, ensuring robust protection against cyber threats. The legislation also champions individual rights by prohibiting any state or local government entity from restricting the use of self-hosted or hardware wallet solutions for personal custody of digital assets. This initiative aligns with a growing trend across the US, where states like Oklahoma, New Hampshire, and Texas are also exploring similar avenues for crypto investment or donation. If passed, H.B. 230 would come into effect on May 7, 2025, positioning Utah at the forefront of state-led crypto investment in America. The bill reflects a broader commitment to technological innovation and fiscal sovereignty in the face of evolving financial landscapes.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared insights into this potential move, highlighting past hesitations and ongoing challenges. Historically, the Foundation avoided staking due to two key issues: regulatory risks and concerns over neutrality during contentious hard forks.\n                                                                Buterin noted that regulatory concerns are now less significant, particularly as industry conditions have evolved. However, the second issue remains unresolved. He emphasized that if the Foundation stakes ETH, it could be forced to take sides during any future hard fork, compromising its neutrality.\n                                                                Currently, the Foundation relies on selling ETH tokens and converting them to stablecoins to fund operations and pay contributors. While this method avoids the risks tied to staking, it has drawn criticism from parts of the community, who argue that staking could provide a more sustainable funding model.\n                                                                Despite its potential, Ethereum staking comes with its own challenges. Staking rewards have been declining in recent months, making it less lucrative than before. Additionally, ETH’s market share recently hit a four-year low, and the token has been underperforming even during the current bullish market. Reduced demand and falling prices are putting pressure on the Foundation to explore alternative revenue streams.\n                                              Buterin addressed the issue on X (formerly Twitter), explaining the Foundation’s cautious stance. “The concerns historically were (1) regulatory, (2) if Ethereum Foundation stakes ourselves, this de-facto forces us to take a position on any future contentious hard fork. The first concern is less than before, but the second one remains. There’s definitely ways to minimize this concern, and we’re recently been exploring them,” he stated.\n                                                                Although there hasn’t been a major Ethereum hard fork in over a year, the risk always exists. If the Foundation stakes its ETH, it may find itself in a position where neutrality is no longer an option during a divisive fork. This remains a significant roadblock to the Foundation’s direct participation in staking.\n                                                                The community, however, has welcomed the transparency with which the Ethereum Foundation is addressing this issue. Many are relieved that leaders like Buterin are openly discussing potential solutions. Should market conditions continue to worsen, staking ETH may become a more viable way to sustain the Foundation’s activities.For now, no definitive decision has been made, and the Foundation continues to evaluate its options. While staking could offer financial benefits, it also raises questions about Ethereum’s governance and the Foundation’s role in maintaining neutrality in the ecosystem.\n                                                                \n                                                             Buterin noted that regulatory concerns are now less significant, particularly as industry conditions have evolved. However, the second issue remains unresolved. He emphasized that if the Foundation stakes ETH, it could be forced to take sides during any future hard fork, compromising its neutrality.\n                                                                Currently, the Foundation relies on selling ETH tokens and converting them to stablecoins to fund operations and pay contributors. While this method avoids the risks tied to staking, it has drawn criticism from parts of the community, who argue that staking could provide a more sustainable funding model.\n                                                                Despite its potential, Ethereum staking comes with its own challenges. Staking rewards have been declining in recent months, making it less lucrative than before. Additionally, ETH’s market share recently hit a four-year low, and the token has been underperforming even during the current bullish market. Reduced demand and falling prices are putting pressure on the Foundation to explore alternative revenue streams.\n                                              Buterin addressed the issue on X (formerly Twitter), explaining the Foundation’s cautious stance. “The concerns historically were (1) regulatory, (2) if Ethereum Foundation stakes ourselves, this de-facto forces us to take a position on any future contentious hard fork. The first concern is less than before, but the second one remains. There’s definitely ways to minimize this concern, and we’re recently been exploring them,” he stated.\n                                                                Although there hasn’t been a major Ethereum hard fork in over a year, the risk always exists. If the Foundation stakes its ETH, it may find itself in a position where neutrality is no longer an option during a divisive fork. This remains a significant roadblock to the Foundation’s direct participation in staking.\n                                                                The community, however, has welcomed the transparency with which the Ethereum Foundation is addressing this issue.

This omission has sparked concern among crypto advocates, though some argue it may be premature to draw conclusions.\n                                                                During his campaign and in the lead-up to his inauguration, Trump appeared to embrace the crypto community. He endorsed the industry at a Nashville conference in July and even launched his own Solana-based meme coin. He also hosted a high-profile “Crypto Ball” event, which attracted prominent industry leaders like the CEO of Crypto.com. These moves positioned Trump as an ally of the crypto space, fueling hopes for supportive policies.\n                                                                However, his inauguration speech and accompanying document of immediate priorities made no mention of cryptocurrency. Instead, the agenda focused on border security, economic challenges, and combating “climate extremism.” The absence of direct references to crypto has caused unease, especially given Trump’s prior rhetoric.\n                                                                Some in the industry remain optimistic, pointing to other developments as evidence of Trump’s favorable stance. A record number of pro-crypto members of Congress were recently elected, and Trump has appointed regulators with supportive views, including a “crypto czar” and a pro-industry SEC leadership team. These steps suggest a broader alignment with crypto interests, even if not explicitly highlighted in his inaugural agenda.\n                                                                Energy policy changes outlined in Trump’s priorities may indirectly impact the crypto sector. His pledge to make the U.S. “energy-dominant” could benefit the energy-intensive mining industry. However, his promise to scale back wind energy—a key power source for some mining operations—has raised questions about the net effect of his proposals.\n                                              The crypto community remains divided on the significance of this omission. Some, like influencer Borovik, have dismissed the concerns as overblown. “People are freaking out for no reason. Trump’s administration is filled with pro-crypto regulators and lawmakers. There’s no need to panic just because crypto wasn’t mentioned in a speech,” Borovik wrote online.\n                                                                Others see the lack of explicit support as a warning sign. While Trump has delivered tangible wins for the industry, such as regulatory appointments, his silence on crypto policy raises doubts about his commitment to long-term support.\n                                                                Despite the uncertainty, many leaders in the crypto space continue to praise Trump’s past efforts. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov described Trump’s focus on crypto as encouraging. “His leadership has helped push for clearer regulations and fostered new opportunities for adoption,” Nazarov said in an interview.\n                                                                For now, the crypto industry will be closely watching Trump’s actions to determine whether his earlier support translates into meaningful policies.

            "full_content": "A summarizing review of what has been happening at the crypto markets. A look at trending sectors, liquidity, volatility, spreads and more. The weekly report in cooperation with market data provider Kaiko. Bitcoin and several altcoins hit an all-time high as markets anticipate a flurry of executive orders following President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration today. This week we explore: The best articles of the week, directly delivered into your mailbox. The 45th, and soon-to-be 47th, President of the United States of America just launched a meme coin. Just three days before his second inauguration Donald Trump, and just a few hours after Gary Gensler's last day as Chair of the SEC, told his followers on X that it was \"time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING,\" before urging supporters to join his community by buying the TRUMP meme coin. Market participants obliged and the price of the newly minted Solana-based meme coin soared over the weekend. TRUMP traded over $72 on Sunday as major centralized exchanges including Coinbase announced plans to list it. The fervor around Trump's meme coin led to it outperforming Dogecoin in terms of trade volume. Since launch, TRUMP has had over $18bn in cumulative trade volume, $4bn more than DOGE. The launch also appears to have benefited some unofficial meme coins such as MAGA Trump which had a record $9bn in volume since Saturday.  However, along with soaring volumes and prices there was also plenty of volatility. While this is natural in meme coin markets, which are inherently speculative, there were two more mitigating factors. Firstly, the launch of an official Melania Trump meme coin: The First Lady's meme coin launched shortly after TRUMP and coincided with a sell-off in her husbands token, likely linked to traders rotating between the two to capture upside in the newer coin. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, the liquidity profile of TRUMP markets is still very shallow. Its market depth—the sum of buy and sell orders 2% from the mid-price—is far below Dogecoin and even below MAGA Trump. Basically this means it's harder to convert TRUMP into stablecoins. As a result any large sell or buy orders could lead to sharp price moves. In other words you can't get out of these positions in size.  The current liquidity situation will continue to be uncertain over the coming days as the market begins to take shape. Below we can see how the liquidity distribution across exchanges for TRUMP has changed since Saturday. As new exchanges list the token the market should become more liquid. For example, Binance now has an active spot market so it should begin to steady soon. Coinbase is also expected to list it later this week, which will open up access to more US-based investors. With more major exchange listings more market makers will be comfortable to engage with the market.  Another factor to watch when examining the liquidity profile of the TRUMP token is the availability of derivatives on the meme coin. Despite only being in its infancy there already exists a substantial market for TRUMP perps. On Bybit alone there is over $300mn in open interest for these perps. However, the perps market is still taking shape, and as we can see below there was a large spike in funding rates on Sunday evening. This means there was likely a large build-up of leverage in the perps markets on Bybit and OKX as traders made increasingly bullish bets.  High positive funding rates imply that traders with long positions are willing to pay more to keep positions open. This can be risky as sharp changes in prices can lead to liquidations. Open interest above is expressed in dollar amounts, and while it does decline following the spike in prices the number of contracts didn't fall as sharply, suggesting that a small number of traders were over their skies on this trade here. The euphoria in crypto markets is likely to continue throughout today as Trump's inauguration takes place. Despite Bitcoin hit a new all-time high in price in early hours of Monday, altcoin showed relative strength. The top 50 altcoin trading volume dominance climbed to 71%, matching levels last seen in early November. Notably, XRP surpassed Bitcoin in trade volume on U.S. exchanges on January 16, while SOL reached an all-time high, likely fueled by the Trump-linked meme token craze.  XRP led the altcoin market in 2025, with a cumulative trading volume of $105 billion, surpassing SOL at $83 billion and DOGE at $56 billion. Since Trump's election victory, XRP has surged by more than 500%, significantly outpacing SOL by a factor of ten.  This trend has been driven largely by U.S. exchanges, with the share of XRP traded on these platforms rising to 21%—its highest level since the SEC lawsuit in 2020. In contrast, only about 10% of SOL's global volume is traded on U.S.-available platforms, making XRP one of the most U.S.-centric altcoins.  This surge in XRP effectively fills the gap left after the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple, which led to delistings from major US exchanges like Coinbase due to regulatory concerns. However, market sentiment could weaken if the second Trump administration's crypto-friendly policies fall short of expectations. \n\n\nMinds\nLucas A.

However, Bitcoin’s ability to withstand macroeconomic headwinds appears to be strengthening. Over the past year, both Bitcoin and gold have shown signs of decoupling from real yields, likely driven by growing demand for fiscal debasement hedges and steady, price-inelastic interest from corporate players like MicroStrategy.  This resilience could grow further if institutional - and potentially sovereign stockpiling - continues. According to Polymarket, the odds of Bitcoin being added to a national reserve within the first 100 days of the new administration have risen above 50% in the early hours of Monday, up from a multi-month low of 22% in early January.

            "full_content": "The cryptocurrency industry wants President Donald Trump to ban the creation of the US Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), commonly referred to as the Digital Dollar. This call to action comes as part of a broader initiative to steer the US financial policy towards embracing decentralized digital assets over government-controlled currencies. Recent reports, including insights from Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret, suggest that Trump might soon sign an executive order to halt the development of a US CBDC. This anticipation is based on Trump’s previous campaign promises where he vowed to protect Americans from what he described as potential “government tyranny” through CBDCs. His stance aligns with the crypto community’s concerns about privacy and government oversight over individual financial activities. The demand isn’t just for a ban on CBDCs; there’s a parallel push for establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This proposal, supported by industry leaders like Michael Saylor and platforms like Coinbase, would see the US government recognizing Bitcoin as a reserve asset, potentially using it to mitigate the massive $36 trillion national debt. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has been a vocal proponent of this idea, advocating for a more Bitcoin-friendly US policy. Further, the crypto industry is looking forward to the formation of a White House Crypto Council, which is expected to be composed of approximately 20 key figures from the sector. This body would advise on digital asset policies, help craft a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, and work closely with Congress on relevant legislation. Trump’s administration has already shown preliminary steps in this direction by appointing David Sacks as the White House’s crypto czar, signalling a commitment to fostering innovation in the crypto space. Another anticipated move from Trump’s administration includes the potential repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) by the SEC leadership, which would further ease regulations around crypto custody by banks. Moreover, there are expectations that US banks will soon be allowed to offer crypto trading services, integrating cryptocurrencies more deeply into traditional finance. The crypto world also watches closely for any action on Trump’s promise to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder, within his first days in office. This move would not only be symbolic but could also signal a major shift in how the government views and treats cryptocurrency-related convictions. As the industry awaits these policy shifts, the market has shown positive reactions, with Bitcoin (BTC) experiencing significant price surges post-election, reflecting the market’s anticipation and hope for a more crypto-friendly US under President Donald Trump. All eyes now remain on the forthcoming actions, as promises made during political campaigns do not always translate into immediate policy changes.

            "full_content": "A whale’s $9.15M ENS deposit into Binance, generating a $4.36M profit, sparked a 1041% inflow spike, highlighting strategic timing and growing market interest.  A whale recently deposited 282,365 Ethereum Name Service [ENS], valued at $9.15M, into Binance via an intermediary wallet. The tokens were sourced from the ENS DAO: Community Reward Funds wallet, where they were valued at $4.78M. This strategic move generated a $4.36M profit for the whale, underscoring their precise market timing. This transaction also coincided with a 1041% spike in 24-hour inflow volume, signaling heightened market activity.  The ENS price chart reflects significant volatility following the whale’s transaction. Currently trading at $34.41, the token shows a recovery from its recent low of $28.00. A notable price surge occurred after the whale’s deposit, with heightened buying activity on Binance potentially offsetting selling pressure. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stood at 50.86, suggesting a neutral trend with room for movement in either direction. If ENS maintains support above $32.00, it may retest resistance near $38.00. However, increased sell-offs could push prices toward the $30.00 level in the short term. On-chain Inflow Volume for ENS saw a dramatic, 1041% increase in the past 24 hours, reflecting heightened market activity. The surge aligns with the whale’s deposit of 282,365 ENS into Binance, as shown in the aggregated exchange data. Source: IntoTheBlock This spike indicates significant trading interest, often tied to a mix of profit-taking and speculative buying. Sustained high inflow volumes may lead to short-term price volatility. However, if inflows stabilize, ENS could consolidate in its current price range. Traders should monitor inflow trends for signs of increasing selling pressure or renewed accumulation. The total number of ENS addresses with balances currently stands at 58.39K, maintaining steady growth. Over the past thirty days, the average was 57.31K, with a high of 57.67K and a low of 56.85K. This consistency suggests strong holder confidence despite market fluctuations. Source: IntoTheBlock Whale activity and inflow spikes did not significantly disrupt the total balance trend, indicating stable broader market participation. If this trend continues, ENS could see sustained network growth, supporting long-term price stability. Traders should monitor these metrics for shifts in market sentiment. Read Ethereum Name Service’s [ENS] Price Prediction 2025-26 Recent whale movements, significant price action, and a sharp rise in on-chain inflow volume highlight growing interest in ENS. Despite increased market activity, the total address balance remained stable, reflecting strong holder confidence. The whale’s $4.36M profit underscores the importance of strategic timing in volatile markets. If ENS maintains network growth and balances buy-and-sell pressures effectively, it could see long-term price stability and broader adoption.    Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

            "full_content": "Generated Image: Midjourney\n\n01.21.2025 The chief executive of the digital asset analytics firm CryptoQuant is outlining what gives President Donald Trump’s newly launched memecoin value. The Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin launched on Friday and rapidly surged in price to become a top-30 crypto asset by market cap. The asset is trading at $40.47 at time of writing and is down nearly 40% in the past 24 hours but up more than 518% since Friday. It already has a market cap of more than $8.1 billion. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says retail traders think that financial markets are all about following trends and “chasing memes.” “What gives Trump’s meme coin its value? Unlike traditional securities, which pool investments for productive activities, celebrity meme coins don’t directly create value. Instead, Trump is likely to use his coin holders as a powerful community base for collective action. If you’re thinking about investing in Trump Coin, the key question is how much influence his community will gain during his presidency. The coin’s value depends entirely on what Trump does. With his fervent fan base, it’s unlikely Trump’s meme coin will ever go to zero – unless he deliberately pulls the rug.” Young Ju says a memecoin’s value depends on whether its associated community acts in ways that benefit society. “A community with goodwill could turn a meme coin into a valuable asset. But on the flip side, it would be terrifying if a cult or terrorist group used a meme coin to build a massive following.” The CryptoQuant executive also predicts that more memecoins will be launched under Trump’s administration. “The Trump administration has embraced free markets instead of regulated markets, and over the next four years, we’re likely to see all kinds of experiments with meme-driven communities in the crypto space. This wave is unstoppable –  at least until 2028.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox \n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

            "full_content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, recently suggested that the Ethereum Foundation is exploring the possibility of staking its vast reserves of ETH, which are currently valued at nearly $1 billion. This comes amid mounting criticism of the foundation’s perceived lack of direct involvement in the Ethereum ecosystem. Many have expressed disappointment with the foundation’s activities, which, according to Josh Stark, have primarily included selling tokens, distributing grants, and organizing events. Ethereum community members, such as investor Eric Conner, have proposed that the foundation consider staking its ETH to generate rewards for operational expenses, such as employee salaries and additional grants. Buterin responded to the concerns on X, explaining that the foundation had avoided staking due to regulatory risks and the complications that could arise during network forks. He highlighted that staking requires choosing a chain to avoid penalties, and unstaking quickly enough to prevent slashing could prove challenging. However, he mentioned that the regulatory landscape has improved, and the foundation is now reconsidering the idea of staking its ETH holdings. As of late 2024, the Ethereum Foundation holds 269,000 ETH, worth roughly $891 million, representing 0.26% of the total Ethereum supply. If the foundation were to stake its holdings on platforms like Lido Finance, it could generate an annual yield of approximately $26.2 million. However, this amount falls significantly short of the $134.7 million the foundation spent in 2023, suggesting that staking alone may not be enough to support its operations. \n\n\n\n Mark Cuban has sharply criticized the TRUMP memecoin, which was launched around the time of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of ConsenSys, has expressed his belief that the growth of Web3 will be far more significant than the dot-com boom of the 1990s. The recent launch of memecoins by the Trump family could mark a new chapter in the cryptocurrency world, driving more retail investors towards high-risk digital assets like altcoins and memecoins. Coinbase has officially added the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin to its platform, supporting the asset on the Solana network (SPL token).

On Monday, the Ethereum Foundation allocated 50,000 ETH worth $165 million to Aave, marking an endorsement of the protocol. Moreover, Aave’s recently launched v3.2’s Liquid eModes live on Arbitrum and Base, and its Total Value Locked (TVL) in terms of ETH hit a new all-time high, all hinting at a rally in the upcoming days. Aave announced that the Ethereum Foundation allocated 50,000 ETH worth $165 million to Aave on Monday, marking an endorsement of the protocol. The foundation has set up a new 3-of-5 multisig wallet and will use it to participate in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This investment could enhance Aave’s liquidity and further integrate it into the Ethereum ecosystem, signaling confidence in its long-term viability. Welcome to Aave, @ethereumfndn https://t.co/EysQK4qxxm At the same time, Aave recently launched v3.2’s Liquid eModes live on Arbitrum and Base. This platform introduces new DeFi primitives and allows users to leverage new collateral types like wstETH and open up unique DeFi use cases with reduced gas costs. This innovation could be seen as a game-changer, potentially attracting more users and increasing the protocol’s total value locked (TVL). Following the strong adoption of Lido @aave isolated markets on Ethereum, v3.2 Liquid eModes are now expanding to L2’s starting with @base and @arbitrum.\n\nUsers can now leverage LRTs as collateral for borrowing wstETH opening up for unique DeFi use cases with reduced gas costs. pic.twitter.com/k04OI5kUFm Moreover, crypto intelligence tracker DefiLlama posted on X on Tuesday that Aave’s TVL, in terms of ETH, has reached a new all-time high (ATH) of 6.53 million on Monday. This increase in TVL indicates growing activity and interest within the Aave ecosystem. It suggests that more users deposit or utilize assets within AAVE-based protocols, adding credence to the bullish outlook.
